# Summary

1. Cosmic microwave background and lensing
2. CAMB
3. Fast, so that it can make lots and lots at multiple levels of fidelity.
4. Useful for computational experiments with machine learning and SBI
5. We create a simple interface for building simulations around camb and namaster.


# Statement of need

1. Most CMB lensing simulators are not use-friendly and don't easily 
2. needed to study B-modes and the effects of additional physics, like different kinds of noise
3. a bridge to more complex simulations and provides a benchmark for those more high-fidelity simulations
4. How does this compare in middle level of detail with pixell and others


# Mathematics

1. Basic lensing of CMB
